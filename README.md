## New in This Version (4.16.0 - August 30, 2017)
- The MoPub Unity Plugin is now compatible with version 4.16.1 of the MoPub Android SDK and version 4.16 of the MoPub iOS SDK.
- Rewarded Videos have a new init method. See `MoPub.initializeRewardedVideo(MoPubRewardedNetwork[])`. Pass in a list of networks to initialize, and MoPub will initialize those networks with the settings from the previous ad request, persisted across app close.
